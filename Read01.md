# How the weB works?
###### 1. When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site;  for example: google.com
###### 2. Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer.
###### 3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.
###### 4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
## HTML:

- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled  X brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

## HTML5 LAYOUT:
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

###### 1. Headers & Footers:
- The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
- A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page
###### 2. Navigation:
The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
###### 3. Articles:
The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
###### 4. Asides:
- When the <aside> element is used inside an <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning.
- When the <aside> element is used outside of an <article> element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.
###### 5. Figures:
- it should only be used when the content simply references the element (and not for something that is absolutely integral to the flow of a page).
Examples of usage include: images, videos, graphs, diagrams
- The figure element should also contain a <figcaption> element which provides a text decription for the content of the figure element.
###### 5. <div>.
## Process & Design.

###### 1. Who is the site For?
the age range of audience, where they live, average income of visitors,
level of education, kind of device they use.....
###### 2. Why People visit your website?
###### 3. What your visitors are trying to achieve? and what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively?

- `Now, you know what needs to appear on your site, So you can start to organize the information into sections or pages This is known as a` *`site map`*

- *`Wireframe:`* is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
